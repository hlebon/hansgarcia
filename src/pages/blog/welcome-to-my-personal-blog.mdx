## Welcome

Hello everyone, in this small article I would like to welcome you to my personal blog.

At the beginning of each year we all set goals that we want to meet, create a blog and write regularly is one of those goals I want to fulfill this 2019.

Not only that but I increased this challenge, I want to create content for this blog not only in my native language but in English. so if you see the Panama flag in a post It means it is in Spanish.

I can sound easy if you already know English but for me is a great challenge.

my English skill is intermediate/advance so this is a way I can force me to get fluent in English and learn more.

I am going to write more about this in another post.

## What can I expect from this blog?

In this blog I will be writing about what I am passionate about, what I learn and what I know, everything focused on software development.

We'll see a bit of `javascript`, `react`,`testing`, `graphql`,`web performance`, `redux`, `firebase`,`aws` and more ...

nothing more to add

thanks for visiting this blog and I hope you come back soon.
