# Hi ðŸ‘‹

Hello world, my name is Hans GarcÃ­a, I am a computer science engineer from PanamÃ¡, I've been programming for 6+ years as fullstack developer with frontend tendencies, the last two years I have been using react.js, **react-native**, **firebase**, **firestore**, **cloud functions**, **postgresql**, **node.js** and **AWS lambda functions** as a my primary stack.

In the pass I worked with .net core, **knockout.js** and **Java**. I think the present/future is serverless.

I love pizza (with pineapple plis), coffee and I prefer tabs over space.
